1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You can't manufacture America The silence was pitiful that day

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:28,000
A love is getting too cynical Passion's just physical these days

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You analyze every one you meet But get no sign, loving eyes

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Every night you admit defeat And cry yourself blind

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:00,000
If you can't wake up in the morning Cause your bed lies weakened at night

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:11,000
If you're lost, hurt, tired or lonely Can't control it, try as you might

7
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:22,000
May I find that love that won't leave you May I find it by the end of the day

8
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You won't be lost, hurt, tired or lonely Something beautiful will come your way

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The DJ said on the radio Life should be stereo each day

10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You prepare to cast the unsuitable State of some kind of beautiful

11
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You just couldn't wait All your friends think you're satisfied

12
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But they can't see your soul No, no, no

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You forgot the time feeling petrified When they left alone

14
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:30,000
If you can't wake up in the morning Cause your bed lies weakened at night

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:41,000
If you're lost, hurt, tired or lonely Can't control it, try as you might

16
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:52,000
May I find that love that won't leave you May I find it by the end of the day

17
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You won't be lost, hurt, tired or lonely Something beautiful will come your way

18
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Some kind of beautiful Some kind of beautiful

19
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Some kind of beautiful All your friends think you're satisfied

20
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:35,000
But they can't see your soul No, no, no

21
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You forgot the time feeling petrified When they left alone

22
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:56,000
If you can't wake up in the morning Cause your bed lies weakened at night

23
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:07,000
If you're lost, hurt, tired or lonely Can't control it, try as you might

24
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:18,000
May I find that love that won't leave you May I find it by the end of the day

25
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You won't be lost, hurt, tired or lonely Something beautiful will come your way

26
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You won't be lost, hurt, tired or lonely Something beautiful will come your way
